# Real-Time-Chat
Real-time bidirectional event-based chat (Socket.io, Node).

## A basic chat application
Socket.IO provides the ability to implement real-time analytics, binary streaming, instant messaging, and document collaboration. Whenever you write a chat message, the idea is that the server will get it and push it to all other connected clients.
